Projects
HR Portal Agent |Capstone Project
•Developed a distributed multi-agent HR system where each agent—built as a self-contained LangChain
chain—handles specialized tasks such as OCR-based resume extraction, semantic candidate matching, and dynamic
interview question generation.
•Created a multi-agent workflow that outputted custom interview questions generated directly from the candidate’s
resume, enhancing the personalization and relevance of interview sessions.
•Employed LangGraph to orchestrate agent workflows, enabling real-time visualization, dynamic routing, and
on-the-fly adjustments between independent modules.
•Designed the candidate matching agent to combine semantic embeddings, rule-based keyword extraction, and
configurable weighted scoring, ensuring high-accuracy candidate ranking.
•Integrated asynchronous communication via RESTful APIs (using Flask/FastAPI) to decouple agents, improve
fault tolerance, and optimize processing efficiency.
•Established feedback loops within the interview generation agent to refine questions based on historical candidate
data and performance insights.
•Architected the solution for scalability and security by containerizing microservices with Docker, implementing
secure API endpoints, encryption, and rate limiting.
•Tools: LangChain, LangGraph, MongoDB, Flask/FastAPI, Docker .
Email AI Agent |Capstone Project
•Developed a multi-agent orchestration system with LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith for managing email
workflows, capable of automating the classification and response processes for incoming emails.
•Integrated SMTP server to facilitate real-time email sending, and employed advanced technologies for robust email
processing and automatic response drafting based on content classification.
•Designed a comprehensive system architecture that includes specialized agent modules for email filtering,
summarization, and response generation, enhancing the efficiency of email management.
•Implemented a dynamic supervisor in LangGraph to coordinate and optimize the workflow between different
agents, ensuring effective classification and drafting of replies.
•Enabled the system to automatically draft and send replies to emails based on their classification as spam, urgent,
or informational, significantly reducing manual intervention and improving response times.
•Tools: LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith, DeepSeek API .
In-Run Data Shapley |Research Project
•Developed a method to compute a Shapley-like contribution score for each training sample with respect to a single
validation sample during training on the MNIST dataset.
•Implemented combined training and validation gradient computation within a single forward pass to assess the
influence of each training sample on validation loss.•Utilized first-order approximations through per-sample gradient dot-products to measure the impact of training
samples on validation example’s loss.
•Conducted multiple backward passes to demonstrate a naive implementation and discussed potential optimizations
using forward/backward hooks for efficiency.
•Analyzed and visualized training data influence, facilitating data cleaning by identifying potentially mislabeled or
harmful samples.
•Provided extensive documentation and a tutorial blog on Medium, illustrating the practical application and insights
from the Shapley values computed during model training.
•Tools: PyTorch, Librosa, NumPy, Matplotlib .
•Project code and detailed explanation available on GitHub: Data-Shapley-in-One-Training-Run-Code and Medium:
