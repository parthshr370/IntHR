CODING QUESTIONS
---------------
Average Score: 40.0/100

Question ID: code_e788c748
Score: 0/100
Feedback: The candidate's answer is completely incorrect. The options provided (return array.sort(), use quicksort algorithm, implement merge sort, use binary search tree) are irrelevant to the question about designing a PyTorch layer with controlled access to a private attribute. The options seem to be related to sorting algorithms, which have nothing to do with information hiding in object-oriented programming within the context of PyTorch layers. The explanation provided is also nonsensical in relation to the given options.

Question ID: code_6bebaf8d
Score: 100/100
Feedback: The candidate correctly identified Option B as the most effective debugging technique for pinpointing specific layers causing overfitting. The explanation provided demonstrates a strong understanding of how `torch.autograd.grad()` can be used to analyze gradient magnitudes and distributions at each layer's output, allowing for the identification of layers with unusually large gradients during validation, which are indicative of overfitting. The candidate also correctly distinguished Option B from the other options, which are general regularization techniques that do not provide layer-specific insights.

Question ID: code_f28547b9
Score: 100/100
Feedback: The candidate correctly identified Option B as the most efficient approach. The explanation is accurate and demonstrates a good understanding of database optimization techniques (indexing) and the trade-offs involved in data loading for machine learning. The reasoning for rejecting the other options is also sound. The candidate clearly understands the performance implications of each approach, especially concerning large datasets and network transfer.

SYSTEM DESIGN QUESTIONS
----------------------
Average Score: 15.0/100

Question ID: design_c4597062
Score: 75/100
Feedback: The candidate provided a good high-level architecture for a collaborative document editing system. The inclusion of a load balancer, application servers, cache, and database is appropriate. The explanation of each component's purpose is clear and concise. The document edit flow is also well-described. However, the solution lacks detail in several key areas, particularly around conflict resolution, real-time collaboration mechanisms beyond WebSockets, and security considerations. The database schema ideas are a good starting point but could be more comprehensive. The scalability considerations are present but not deeply explored. The solution also misses crucial aspects of security.
